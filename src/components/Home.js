          I've always had a passion for games and programming. I've been playing
          them since I was a kid, and I started making my own games and web apps

          When it comes to games, it's a bit of an emotional roller coaster for
          me. Whether I'm playing alone or with friends, I just get so caught up
          in the story and the world that's been created. It's like getting lost
          in a really good book - you just can't put it down.

          I also really enjoy working closely with my teammates to create
          experiences that users will love. I've been fortunate enough to work
          on some amazing projects both on my own and as part of a team. There's
          nothing quite like that feeling of pride when you've worked together
          to create something truly meaningful.
